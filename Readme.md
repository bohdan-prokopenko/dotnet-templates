# Project Title

MiniApi Project Template using dotnet new

## Description

This project template provides a starting point for creating web applications using the Minimal API approach in .NET. It leverages the `dotnet new` command to generate a basic project structure with minimal configuration and ceremony.

### What is Minimal API?

Minimal API is a lightweight approach introduced in ASP.NET Core 6.0 that simplifies the development of web applications by reducing the amount of boilerplate code and configuration required. It allows developers to define HTTP endpoints and routes using a minimalistic syntax, making it easier and faster to build APIs and web applications.

### Features

- **Minimal Configuration**: The project template generates a minimal set of files and configurations, eliminating unnecessary complexity and allowing developers to focus on writing code.

- **Lightweight Syntax**: The Minimal API approach uses a concise syntax for defining endpoints and routes, making it intuitive and straightforward to create HTTP-based services.

- **Rapid Development**: With the project template, you can quickly get started with developing your web application, thanks to the simplified setup and reduced ceremony.

- **Flexible and Extensible**: Despite its minimalistic nature, the Minimal API approach is highly flexible and extensible. You can easily add middleware, authentication, authorization, and other components to customize your application as needed.
